                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon the Buyer awarding a project to the Seller, and the Seller's acceptance on the Website, or the purchase of an item by a Buyer from the Seller, the
                    Buyer and Seller will be deemed to have entered into a User Contract under which the Buyer agrees to purchase, and the Seller agrees to deliver the Seller
                    Services. You agree not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict with the User Agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with your obligations to other Users. If you do not, you may become liable to that User. You must
                    ensure that you are aware of any domestic laws (including common law), international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to you as a Buyer
                    or Seller, or in any other uses you make of the Website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If another User breaches any obligation to you, you are solely responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have. For the avoidance of doubt, we have
                    no responsibility for enforcing any rights under a User Contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on their jurisdiction, Sellers and Buyers may have rights under statutory warranties that cannot lawfully be excluded. Nothing in this User
                    Agreement is intended to override a right that by applicable law may not be excluded.

                    Each User acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between Buyers and Sellers is that of an independent contractor. Nothing in this User Agreement
                    creates a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship between Users. Nothing in this User Agreement shall in any way be construed as

                    You may have funds in your Account if you have prepaid for fees or charges or for services to be provided to you via the Website. If you are a Seller, you
                    may have funds if you have successfully completed a Project, or sold an item, and funds have been released to you. There are also circumstances where funds
                    will have been credited to your Account in relation to an affiliate program or a referral program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Funds in your Account are held by us in our operating accounts held with reputable financial institutions. Funds in your Account are not held separately by

                    You are not entitled to any interest, or other earnings for funds that are in your Account.

                <p>
                    We may receive interest on funds held by us in our operating accounts (which may include funds in your Account) from financial institutions with whom we
                    hold our operating accounts. Any such interest earned belongs to us and we will not be liable to any User for any imputed interest on such funds.

                        if you have funds in multiple currencies in your Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may set-off the negative amount

                <p>
                    If the amount the User has asked to refund relates to: (1) our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause "Disputes with Us" must be followed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the same payment method(s) that the User used to make the original payment to us. We
                    may, in our sole discretion, use an alternative payment method in exceptional circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if: (1) we are required by law or consider that we are required
                    by law to do so; (2) we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs; (3) we refund funds to the User in
                    accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time; (4) we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent; (5) the User
                    made a duplicate payment in error; or (6) we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card
                    chargeback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can request a refund by using our <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>user_agreement">customer support website</a> or emailing us at    <a href="mailto:support@SmartCardMarket.com" target="_top">support@SmartCardMarket.com</a>. If you have done so, you must not initiate a chargeback request
                    with your credit card issuer until such time as all reasonable efforts have been exhausted with us to resolve your request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of funds by contacting us and must not seek
                    double recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund
                    funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your Account.
                </p>

                    party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed
                    by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
